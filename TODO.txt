#1 1/3 powerups made, add 2 more
#2 implement Pause button
#3 make levels.

Ideas: 
#1 make diffrent types of bricks, some requires more hits to break, some are indestructible, some are breakable but give you a powerup.
#2 make the bricks, balls and paddle suit the theme of game.
#3 make the game screen bigger.

Bugfixes:
#1 brick side collision? (might be fixed)
#2 powerups spawn twice, issue is in movePowerup function
#3 powerup collision with paddle, issue is in movePowerup function
#4 ball collision with paddle(goes through the ends of the paddle sometimes) issue is probably in moveBall function
#5 time doesn't stop when game is paused (might be fixed)
#6 either make the power ups fall slower or make the paddle move faster to make it a beter ratio.
#7 fix scaling issues in the rolling intro(the text "Press space to start" goes out of the screen)
#7.5 fix so that the text "Press space to start" doesn't go in/over the rolling text.
